o	Adjust for Changes in Working Capital: 
ï‚§	Analyze the changes in current asset and liability accounts between the beginning and ending balance sheets. 
ï‚§	Current Assets: 
				- Increase in accounts receivables will be subtracted 					from net income.
				- Increase in Inventory will be subtracted from net 					income.
				- Increase in prepaid expenses will be subtracted from 				net income.
				- Decrease in accounts receivables will be added from 				net income.
